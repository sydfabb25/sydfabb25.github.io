#### My Angle
The inclusion of the three categories of photography, places and things, people, and animals, allows one to establish that the diverse abilities of the designer. The use of colour and composition are present in all photos, and are used wisely. The inclusion of the three categories also demonstrates that I have many different interests when it comes to what I would like to photograph.
