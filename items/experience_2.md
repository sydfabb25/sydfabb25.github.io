#### My Angle
By the end of the season, athletes have put in a tremendous amount of work into their field.  This results of project act as memorabilia for each athlete who participated in a sport.  With the inclusion of the school's school colours, as well as their mascot and school name, these athletes will have something to remember their time as a high school athlete. 

### The "Yearbook Divider Page" Project

#### My Angle
A yearbook acts as something to commemorate a student's time at their school.  I wanted these pages to be representative of each section that can take place at school; academics, athletics, and clubs.  Each photo on the art piece shares a snippet into the content about to come, while reminiscing on the memories from the past school year.
