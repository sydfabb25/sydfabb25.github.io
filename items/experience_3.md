### The "Meditation Site" Project

Task: create a site where users can learn anything they may need to know about meditation. 

#### Faceted Inventory 
Creating a faceted inventory allowed me to collect information that I saw valuable to include into my site. It also allowed me to create facets of how I thought users may organize the information.

#### Open Card Sort
With the information from the faceted inventory, I created an open card sort to analyze how the users would organize the information about meditation. Once the study was complete, I was left with five overall facets to organize the content; about meditation, effects on meditation, types of meditation, how-to meditate, and frequently asked questions.

#### Tree Test 
I was then able to conduct a tree test to establish how well the users could navigate the site. I created two scenarios for the users to test, and was able to conclude that the language of the site needed to still be altered to allow for a greater number of users to understand the content.

#### Final Recommendations
With the knowledge from the faceted inventory, the open card sort, and the tree test, I created a sitemap and wireframes to create a visualization of my meditation site.  I also addressed the specific navigation systems, search systems, and metadata that would be included.
