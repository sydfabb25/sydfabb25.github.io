User Experience Design

### The "Meditation Site" Project
#### My Angle

I wanted to create the structure for a site that allows users to easily navigate their way through content about meditation. With the help of multiple user studies, I was able to design a site that was easy for users to understand, and contained much content on the topic.  

Task: create a site where users can learn anything they may need to know about meditation. 

#### Faceted Inventory 
Creating a faceted inventory allowed me to collect information that I saw valuable to include into my site. It also allowed me to create facets of how I thought users may organize the information.
