Swim Instructor
---
### What was it that you did?

I taught swimming lessons to both children and adults, all the while ensuring their safety in the water. 

### When did you do it?

I began working as a swim instructor in 2017 and I still am one. I began when I was 15 and now I am 19. 

### What was good about it?

I absolutely love working with children. It is an incredible opportunity and such a rewarding job. 

### What was your favourite memory of it? 

I especially loved the satisfaction of watching a child finally learn a skill that they had been struggling with. 

### What didn't you enjoy about it? 

I least enjoyed failing a child in a level. Sometimes the child's parents made doing my job difficult.
